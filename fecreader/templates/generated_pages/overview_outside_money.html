        <p>The numbers on this page refer to <a href="http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/indexp.shtml">"independent expenditures"</a>, the most important class of spending by which outside groups and party committees get involved in federal elections. Most of the money comes from groups that aren't subject to contribution limits, and some do not report their donors at all. By law, these groups cannot "coordinate" with the candidate they are supporting or opposing, though those rules have been criticized as ineffectual.</p>

<div class="numeric_summary">
<span class="amount_description">Supporting a candidate:</span>&nbsp;<span class="amount_dollars">${{ sums.positive|intword }}</span>
<br><span class="amount_description">Opposing a candidate:</span>&nbsp;<span class="amount_dollars">${{ sums.negative|intword }}</span>
</div>
<p>Groups making independent expenditures must indicate whether the action either supports or opposes the candidates; there's no option to say that a single communication does both. Some groups, however, seem to report a single ad buy in two parts. The determination of whether a communication is positive or negative is solely up to the submitting group and is not audited.</p>

<div class="numeric_summary">
<span class="amount_description">Super PACs:</span>&nbsp;<span class="amount_dollars">${{ sums.super_pacs|intword }}</span>

<br><span class="amount_description">Other PACs:</span>&nbsp;<span class="amount_dollars">${{ sums.oth_committees|intword }}</span>
</div>
<p>Super PACs include "hybrid super PACs"; Party committees include all party committees, not just the four major ones. Non-committees are groups--typically 501(c)4s--that haven't registered as political groups with the FEC, but do report their independent expenditures. Other PACs include traditional PACs which are subject to contribution limits.</p>

</div>
<p>The committees making independent expenditures are not required to declare their political affiliation; reporters at Sunlight have classified them based on their spending patterns. Approximately ${{ sums.no_affil|intcomma }} in spending is not characterized as either leaning left or right.</p>
